# AI-Mahir

Hello, my name is Mahir. This is a project which I would like to develop Ubuntu (Linux) based AI assistant. This is an open project to improve collectively. So I am open to any help which can improve it.

I will start from scratch with the console. My aim developing an assistant which has a unique interface and do everything which Siri and Cortana do.

So please help me.
